# Bathymetry Plot
Program to plot and visualise Bathymetric Data. Featuring a GUI with the
hopes that the program will be applicable to other areas that benefit
from 3D mapping and heat maps.

## About
Having previously been made aware of a similar project, but not having
the opportunity to do it. I have decided to pursue this in my own time.
The idea of the project is to build an executable, distributable, and
(hopefully) use-able program, that plots 3D mesh graphs of Bathymetric
Data stylised with a color scheme, similar to that of heat maps, to help
show altitudes relative to sea level. Fully complete with documentation
and a decent Git repository.
